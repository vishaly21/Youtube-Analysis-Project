I start by creating a YouTube API Key to access YouTube data, guiding through the setup and usage. I then explore Google's YouTube API documentation and sample Python code to understand how to fetch various data. 

The project is built in Jupyter Notebook, beginning with the creation of a new virtual environment using Anaconda, followed by the installation of necessary packages like "google-api-python-client," pandas, and seaborn.

The project is divided into two parts. In the first part, I extract and analyze channel details, including the channel name, total subscribers, views, and videos for several Data Analyst/Data Scientist channels. The data is loaded into a pandas DataFrame and visualized for comparison.

In the second part, I focus on extracting video details from a specific channel, such as video title, views, likes, dislikes, and comments. This data is also analyzed and visualized using Seaborn.
